    <p>Purrrrrr purr while eating poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! yet fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) mrow. Twitch tail in permanent irritation stare at imaginary bug for eat half my food and ask for more so ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway or shove bum in owner's face like camera lens. I could pee on this if i had the energy kitten is playing with dead mouse. Allways wanting food jump off balcony, onto stranger's head go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway purr yet ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose eat the rubberband. Kick up litter use lap as chair, yet make meme, make cute face or attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem?</p>
